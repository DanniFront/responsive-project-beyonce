            <h3>Why is Beyoncé the best?</h3>
            <p class="artist-text">
              It’s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyoncé is a
              globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible
              dancer, actress and performer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the
              sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas
              internationally. She has performed at presidential inaugurations
              and the Super Bowl. Beyoncé has been at the peak of the music
              world for over 20 years and has always successfully reinvented
              herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop,
              rock, country and blues.
              <br />
              <br />
              She has sold over 200 million records and is the most-awarded
              female artist of all time. You can call her Queen Bey!

                <p>
                  ‘Crazy In Love’ features a rap-verse from her future husband
                  Jay-Z and was Beyonce’s official debut single! It’s an iconic
                  song that is often listed as one of the best pop songs of all
                  time.

                  “I look and stare so deep in your eyes, I touch on you more
                  and more every time, When you leave, I'm begging you not to
                  go, Call your name two, three times in a row...”

                <h4>Halo</h4>
                <p>
                  ‘Halo’ was recorded for Beyonce’s third studio album. It’s a
                  power ballad and a really uplifting track that I can listen to
                  over and over, though I don’t think the lyrics are as strong
                  as many of her other songs.

                <h4>Run The World (Girls)</h4>
                <p>
                  ‘Run The World (Girls)’ is from Beyonce’s fourth studio album.
                  It’s an electropop and R&B song that’s all about female
                  empowerment! It wasn’t as loved as a lot of her songs but I
                  love how unapologetic and powerful it is.
