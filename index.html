          <h3>Why is Beyonce the best?</h3>
          <p>It’s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyonce is a globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible dancer, actress and performer.
          </br>
          </br>
          Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas internationally. She has performed at presidential inaugurations and the Super Bowl. Beyonce has been at the peak of the music world for over 20 years and has always successfully reinvented herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop, rock, country and blues.
